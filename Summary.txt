Outlook:
--------
1) The Indian RAC market promises tremendous growth potential owing to its lower penetration as 
   compared to its global counterparts. The Indian RAC market volumes are expected to record a 
   CAGR of 12.8% from FY 2017 to FY 2022.
									--------------------
									From FY 2018, Report 
									--------------------
									Global 		: 30  %		
									China 		: 100 %
									Japan		: 91  %
									Malaysia	: 54  %
									Thailand	: 30  %
									India 		: 4   %
									--------------------
2) Many households are even installing multiple air conditioners. The change in the climatic 
   conditions and prolonged summers are further driving the need for an AC comfort. Several 
   schools and office places which were earlier dependent on fans are now installing ACs. 
   The replacement cycle has also come down from an average of 12 -15 years to 7 - 8 years 
   due to the usage pattern of new generation.
3) The Indian HVAC market is expected to reach $5.9 billion by 2024, registering a CAGR of 7% 
   during 2014-24 period (Source: globenewswire.com). This market growth can be attributed to
   the increasing number of high-rise buildings, shopping complexes & malls, and hypermarkets.
4) Threats:
	1) Downward trend in OEM/ODM Business: 
		If existing Brand’s do not continue to outsource the manufacturing of their products or 
		reduce the amount of outsourcing, it could pose a possible threat for the Company.
	2) Import duty structure:
		Any change in import duty structure towards lowering of import duties shall trigger 
		possibility of outsourcing from China. Thus, posing threat to our companies RAC business 
	3) Client Concentration: 
		The Company’s business is largely dependent on certain key customers for a significant 
		portion of its sales. The loss of any one of the key customers or a significant reduction 
		in demand from such customers could have an adverse effect on our business.

-----------
Conclusion:
-----------
1) Amber Enterprises has tremendous growth potential as the RAC market is under penetrated in India.
2) The company has CRISIL A+/Stable, as it has a strong balance sheet and liquidity.
3) As this manufacturing company, the operating margins (OPM) are low at 8 % which is better than it's
   peers like Dixon Technology that has OPM of 5 %.
4) The Acqusition of Sidwal Refrigeration Industries, despite the gains, will affect the working 
   capital management as the its customers are government entities (Inherntly Inefficient).
5) Even as Amber Enterprises is diversifying, it is still focusing on its core, which is the RAC business
   and key reason for all the acqusitions is, to increase the ability to Innovate and gain expertise in 
   new Technologies like Inverter ACs.
6) The Ambers revenue peaks around Summer season, Q1 and Q2, while Dixon's revenue peaks around the 
   festive season, Q3 and Q4. (Something to think about ah?)
